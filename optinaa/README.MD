# OptiNAA
A program meant to aid "KayZero for Windows" users in the determination of Uranium-235 enrichment in complex samples by Instrumental k0-NAA. It employs "apparent" natural-U concentration and natural-U "proposed" fission corrections reported by KayZero to determine the enrichment factor and, to propose modified correction factors



**The file (PowerPoint) "help.ppt" contains a Tutorial on how to use the program**

If you need to change the channel parameters **f** and **alpha**, open:

**OptiNAA\dat\channels.dat** with a text editor like **NotePad**

The following will be shown:


| Channel        | f           | alpha  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| BR1/Y4      | 37.5 | 0.0620 |
|   BR1/S84	  | 17.5      |   -0.0130 |


Change the value of **f** and **alpha** for the respective channel.
Save the file and close it.
